# Line-following-robot-STM32-using-HAL-library
  I have used 3 CNY70 sensors and l293d motors driver.
  I have used cubeMX to configure I/O pins.
  Funtion names used are in french, "versLaDroite" means "goRight", "versLaGauche" means "goLeft" and "avance" means "goForward".
# Pins used are as follow:
  PC1 left sensor.
  PC2 middle sensor.
  PC3 right sensor.
  PE1 and PE3 left motor forward and backward consecutively.
  PE2 and PE4 right motor forward and backward consecutively.
Have fun.
